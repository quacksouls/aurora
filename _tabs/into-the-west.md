title: Into the West
order: 4
---

Your immediate objective here is to recruit Rubella. From here on, most if not
all battles will be fought against multiple enemies. You need as many members in
your party as possible to help you fight. Rubella specializes in healing magic
and ailment protection. Use her to heal the party member that does most of the
fighting during a battle. Whenever possible, use her to attack an enemy or knock
an enemy out of the Cast stage. After Rubella joins your party, equip a Rough or
Tumbled Ruby in Rubella's weapon slot to add fire damage to her attack. Also
equip a Rough Emerald or Tumbled Emerald in Rubella's armour slot to boost her
earth defense. For now, use her skill points to get Ailment Protection level 1,
Ailment Protection (All) level 1, and Tumble level 2. For Aurora, work toward
acquiring Light Ray level 2.

An enemy you should be careful of is the wolf. It has a skill called Numbing
Bite that causes a status effect where the affected party member's speed is
temporarily decreased. This enemy is weak against Aurora's light magic, but
melee attack is also effective against the wolf.

Notable loots:

-   Healing Tonic x 6. Restores 50% of HP.
-   Potent Healing Tonic. Restores 100% of HP.
-   Revive x 2. Consume to revive a fallen ally. The potion also restores 80% of
    HP. Rubella has the revive skill, which you should use instead of the Revive
    potion.
-   Magic Potion x 7. Restores 75% of MP.
-   MP Stardust. Permanently increases the MP of a party member by three points.
-   HP Stardust x 2. Permanently increases the HP of a party member by five
    points. One is obtained after defeating the Ogre.
-   Strength Stardust. Permanently increases the strength of a party member by
    three points.
-   Defense Stardust x 2. Permanently increases the defense of a party member by
    three points.
-   Firefly Elixir x 2
-   Rough Sapphire x 4
-   Rough Emerald x 5
-   Rough Ruby x 3

## Ogre

Before the fight, equip a Tumbled Sapphire in Aurora's accessory slot to grant
her 10% of dodging an attack. Do the same for Rubella. The Ogre is accompanied
by two wolves. The boss himself is weak against melee attack, while the two
wolves are weak against Aurora's light magic. As the wolves can temporarily
decrease a party member's speed through the Numbing Bite skill, you should start
the fight by using Rubella to cast Ailment Protection (All) so that both of
Aurora and Rubella would be protected against any status effect. Use Aurora's
Light Ray to get rid of one wolf at a time. Whenever possible, use Rubella's
Tumble skill to help Aurora get rid of a wolf. With both wolves defeated, let
Aurora and Rubella take turn to interrupt the Ogre and knock him out of the Cast
stage, all the while using Igniculus to slow down the boss.
