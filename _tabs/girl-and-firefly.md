In this tutorial portion of the game, you will meet Igniculus and grab Aurora's
melee weapon. Aurora specializes in light magic, but her sword is also effective
against many enemies. Use Aurora's skill points to obtain Light Ray and
Starlight, upgrading these skills as you progress in the game.

Igniculus will show you the purpose of wishes, flowering plants with glowing
lights. Wishes are generously peppered throughout each area of the game and
serve three purposes:

1. Heal Aurora. The amount of HP restored depends on Aurora's level. The higher
   is Aurora's level, the more HP that wishes would restore.
1. Restore Aurora's MP, the amount of MP restored being dependent on Aurora's
   level. The higher is Aurora's level, the more MP that wishes would restore.
1. Restore some of Igniculus' light bar. As long as Igniculus' light bar is not
   empty, you can use Igniculus to heal Aurora. Position Igniculus on Aurora's
   torso and hold the left mouse button.

During combat in a casual playthrough, wishes have the above three effects. In
expert difficulty, wishes only restore Igniculus' light bar during combat.

Take this opportunity to learn the basic of combat in the game. Always start a
(non-boss) battle with a "Surprise Strike", which gives you the first chance to
attack an enemy. Before combat begins, initiate a "Surprise Strike" as follows.
Position Igniculus on an enemy's head and hold the left mouse button. The enemy
would cover its eyes from Igniculus' intense light. While the enemy is shielding
its eyes, position Aurora by the enemy's torso and release the left mouse
button. The video above shows the basic of combat.

Notable loots:

-   Healing Tonic. Restore 50% of HP. Save these for boss fights. Consider using
    Igniculus to restore some of Aurora's HP.
-   Magic Potion. Restore 75% of MP. Useful during fights against bosses that
    are weak against elemental damage.
-   Firefly Elixir. Instantly restores Igniculus' light metre. Especially useful
    during a boss fight. You should first use wishes to restore Igniculus' light
    bar. A Firefly Elixir should be used when absolutely necessary.
-   Rough Ruby x 1. Enemies in this area are weak against fire. Equip a Ruby in
    Aurora's weapon slot to add fire damage to her melee attack.

All enemies in this area are weak against fire. To add fire damage to Aurora's
sword, open your oculi menu and equip at least a Rough Ruby on her sword. In
case you have three Rough Rubies, craft them into a Tumbled Ruby and equip the
crafted oculi instead. You might have to do a number of farming rounds to obtain
Rough Ruby x 3. After a farming round, quit the game to menu then load your game
again to respawn all (non-boss) enemies. Remember to equip a Diamond (Rough,
Tumbled, Faceted, or Brilliant) in Aurora's armour slot to earn bonus XP from
the defeat of each enemy.

Equip an Emerald in Aurora's armour slot to boost her earth defense. With three
Rough Emeralds, you can craft a Tumbled Emerald. Equip a Tumbled Emerald in
Aurora's armour slot to gain 14% resistance from earth damage.
