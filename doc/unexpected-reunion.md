title: An Unexpected Reunion
---

Norah will join your party. You don't have to complete any side quests for her
to be a member of your party. Simply explore the area and sooner or later you
will find her. Norah's skills are useful for boosting the speed of an ally as
well as decreasing the speed of a targeted enemy. Her skill Quicken can increase
the speed of a party member so you don't have to use a Quicken Elixir. Her skill
Unstoppable allows a party member to be immune from interruption while casting,
making Norah immeasurably useful during boss fights. The skill Lull decreases
the speed of a targeted enemy, the same effect as that of the Lull Elixir.
Norah's melee attack has a chance to petrify an enemy, paralyzing them for a few
seconds. Whatever you do, don't use a Stardust to permanently upgrade her stats.
In a later part of the game, Norah will leave the party for the rest of the
playthrough.

Use Norah's skill points to acquire at least Unstoppable level 1 and Charm Time
level 1. Unstoppable level 1 protects a party member from interruption for four
turns, immensely useful during boss fights. Charm Time level 1 is a passive
skill that allows Norah to begin at 20% on the timeline. This should allow Norah
to quickly use her skills to boost the speed of a party member or reduce the
speed of a targeted enemy.

Most enemies in this area are weak against fire. Equip at least a Faceted Ruby
in the weapon slots of Aurora and Golem, if you have him, or a Faceted Ruby in
the weapon slot of Rubella. Finn's magic should only be used as a last resort as
you want to conserve his MP for boss fights. The fire-based enemies are weak
against water. Equip a Tumbled or Faceted Sapphire in the weapon slot of one
party member to deal with such enemies.

You should have picked up a side quest from a Capilli maiden. To advance her
quest line, search for Achilles the flying pig. Achilles is found in the area
where you collect a Strength Stardust. The area is guarded by a tripod archer.
Defeat the archer first, then attempt to grab Achilles.

<!--=========================================================================-->

## Giant Boulder

A giant version of the regular boulders scattered throughout the area. This
giant version is fire-based and is weak against water. Equip a Faceted Ruby in
the armour slot of Aurora and a Tumbled Citrine in her weapon slot. Equip a
Brilliant Sapphire in the weapon slot of Golem (or Norah) and a Tumbled or
Faceted Ruby in Golem's (or Norah's) armour slot. The boss is accompanied by two
regular sized, fire boulders. First, get rid of the regular sized boulders.
Whenever possible, use a skill that can target multiple enemies. The boss by
itself is rather easy.
