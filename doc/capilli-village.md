At Capilli Village, you interact with two NPCs to initiate two quest lines. The
first NPC is Avo, who is Finn's grandfather. Avo's quest, called Pastoral Panic,
requires you to return to Mathildis Forest to defeat three giant spiders who are
roaming Avo's garden. The second NPC is a Capilli maiden who has lost her pig
Achilles. The Capilli maiden's quest, called Achilles's Odyssey, requires you to
travel to the next area and search for the pig Achilles.

Enemies in this area are weak against fire. Equip at least a Faceted Ruby in one
party member's weapon slot to add fire defense to melee attack. You might want
to use Golem to fight alongside Aurora as Golem can tank all enemies. There are
no area bosses to fight.
