# The Duke and the Duchess

Use Aurora's skill points to get Elevate Damage, which increases an ally's
damage output by 25% for four turns. Use Golem's skill points to get at least
Shock. This skill decreases the speed of an enemy by 50% for two turns. Use
Norah's skill points to get Lull level 2 and Petrify level 2. The skill Lull
level 2 decreases the speed of an enemy by 60% for four turns, whereas Petrify
level 2 has 30% chance to paralyze an enemy for four seconds whenever Norah uses
her melee attack. Use Finn's skill points to get Rage of the Capilli level 2, a
passive skill that increases the damage of his magic by 20%.

Interact with Magna and he would lift Aurora up to the sky, bringing you to the
next area of the game. This new area can be tricky to explore due to the strong
wind that tends to push Aurora toward the opposite direction of where she should
be going. At various parts of the area, gusts of wind tend to push Aurora into
spikes that can cause a lot of HP damage. Take your time and explore gingerly.
Wait for a wind gust to subside before you go in a particular direction.

You will find Tristis, Rubella's brother, in this area. His skills overlap those
of Norah. Tristis can be considered a replacement for Norah because Norah would
soon leave your party. With Norah gone, use the skills of Tristis to grant the
effects of the skills Unstoppable and Quicken of Norah. Furthermore, Tristis has
the skill Ultimate Armor which can reduce the physical and magic damage taken by
an ally. The skill Ultimate Armor will be useful against the end-game bosses.
Use Tristis' skill points to obtain Unstoppable level 2, Ultimate Armor level 2,
and Haste.

Enemies in this area are difficult due to their defense, damage output, and
their elemental variety. Some enemies can counter your melee attack. You will
find enemies that are weak against light, lightning, water, and fire. Finn is
especially useful for fighting the elemental enemies in the area. Expect to
consume various potions to restore his HP and MP. You should also consider
equipping various oculi in the weapon slots of some party members to boost their
elemental damage output. For example, a Brilliant Sapphire adds water damage to
an ally's melee attack and increases their damage output by 16%, useful for
dealing with fire-based enemies. Similarly, a Brilliant Emerald adds lightning
damage to melee attack and buffs an ally's melee attack by 16%, useful for
fighting water-based enemies. Aurora's light magic, especially Light Ray, is
generally more useful against enemies in this area than her melee attack.
Despite this, consider equipping a Tumbled or Faceted Citrine in her weapon
slot. Wraiths are scattered here and there. During battle, focus on defeating
all wraiths prior to directing your attention to other enemies. Tripod archers
are common in this area. They are strong against melee attacks, can dodge your
attacks, and counter your melee attacks. Get rid of other enemies first before
you concentrate on a tripod archer and use Aurora's Light Ray as much as
possible.

## Giant Griffon

This boss is accompanied by two dark ghosts. Start the fight by using Norah to
cast Unstoppable and Quicken on Aurora and cast Lull on the boss. Let Aurora
cast Elevate Damage on herself to buff her damage output. Use Aurora's Light Ray
(All) to get rid of the ghosts as soon as possible. Use Rubella to heal Aurora
or feed Aurora a potion to restore her HP. With the two ghosts defeated, use
Rubella to cast Ailment Protection on Aurora because when the boss is
interrupted it would try to reduce the speed of your party members. Now use
melee attacks on the boss itself.
