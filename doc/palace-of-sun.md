Enemies in this area are weak against lightning, light, and physical attacks.
You should now have crafted Brilliant versions of most oculi. Equip a Brilliant
Sapphire in Aurora's accessory slot, a Brilliant Amethyst in her armour slot,
and a Brillaint Citrine in her weapon slot. Óengus and Aurora (and Golem if you
have him) should fight most enemies to help you conserve the MP of Finn,
Tristis, and Rubella. Equip a Brilliant Sapphire in Golem's accessory slot and
at least a Faceted Emerald in his weapon slot. As for Óengus, equip a Brilliant
Sapphire in his accessory slot, a Brilliant Amethyst in his armour slot, and a
Brilliant Emerald in his weapon slot. During battle, focus on defeating a wraith
(if any) as soon as possible, then turn your attention to the remaining enemies.
Aurora and Óengus should use skills that target multiple enemies at the same
time.

You will pull a lever to open the path to the area boss. Below the arena is an
area that appears to be an abandoned theatre. Enter the theatre to interact with
Nox, the area boss, who would fill the room with poison gas. Your immediate
objective is to pull two levers to open the path to the boss arena, doing so as
quickly as possible because the poison gas constantly drains the HP of Aurora.
Ignore all treasures for the moment. Open the path and travel upward through a
tunnel, but don't enter the boss arena. Stop at the platform that has three
treasure chests and a wishes plant. It's now safe to enter the theatre again to
collect all treasures.

## Nox

Aurora and Finn should be fighting. You don't need any other allies to help you.
Equip a Brilliant Sapphire in Aurora's armour slot to boost her water defense.
Finn's magic is effective against Nox. Equip a Brilliant Diamond in his
accessory slot, a Brilliant Sapphire in his armour slot, and a Faceted Onyx in
his weapon slot.

Nox is a sea serpent. You want to target her head and her two tentacles. Bring
Aurora and Finn to the fight. Start the fight by letting Finn consume an
Unstoppable Elixir (All). Aurora should cast Elevate Damage on Finn to boost his
magic attack. Let Finn cast Lightning Strike (All) to get rid of the tentacles
as quickly as possible. Aurora should use her melee attack to help dispatch of
the tentacles, and heal Finn. With Nox by herself, let Aurora use a Lull Elixir
on Nox and let Finn cast Lightning Strike on the boss.
