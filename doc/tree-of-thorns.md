title: The Tree of Thorns

You should now have the Map of Lemuria. The map allows you to quickly travel
between different areas of the game, particularly useful whenever you need to
travel to a distant area to complete a quest line. The rapid travel is also
useful whenever you need to farm enemies to level up.

Use Aurora's skill points to obtain Counterattack level 2 and Light Ray (All).
As for Rubella, use her skill points to get Tumble (All). Enemies in this area
are weak against fire. Equip a Faceted Ruby in Aurora's weapon slot to add fire
damage to her sword and increase her damage output by 12%. Equip a Faceted
Emerald in Aurora's armour slot to reduce earth damage by 18%. In Aurora's
accessory slot, equip a Faceted Sapphire to grant her 15% chance of dodging an
attack while casting. Have a similar setup for Rubella if you have any Faceted
oculi to spare.

If you have The Golem's Plight DLC, you would be able to recruit Golem to your
party. You must complete Golem's side quest before he can join your party. Golem
is useful as a tank. His skills are centred around manipulating the speed of an
enemy on the timeline. His Bump Back skill is a passive skill where his melee
attack has a chance to knock an enemy back on the timeline. His Paralyze skill
has a chance to temporarily freeze an enemy on the timeline. Finally, his Shock
skill reduces an enemy's speed on the timeline. Golem together with Igniculus
can significantly reduce the speed of a powerful enemy.

Notable loots:

-   Magic Potion x 3
-   Healing Tonic x 2
-   Revive
-   Antidote. Removes all status ailments inflicted by enemies. Whenever
    possible, you should use Rubella to cast Ailment Protection.
-   Defense Stardust. Obtained from defeating the Giant Bird.
-   Rough Emerald x 5
-   Rough Ruby

The most powerful enemy in this area is the griffon. It shouldn't pose much of a
threat provided you use Igniculus to slow it down while you concentrate on
getting rid of its minions.

## Giant Bird

This boss is a giant version of the birds you encountered at Mahthildis Forest.
Aurora and Rubella are more than capable of fighting the boss. The boss is
accompanied by a spider and a wolf. The spider is weak against fire. Equip a
Faceted Ruby in Aurora or Rubella's weapon slot and concentrate on getting rid
of the spider as quickly as possible. Next, use Aurora's Light Ray to defeat the
wolf. The Giant Bird is weak against fire. Use Aurora and Rubella's melee
attacks to fight the boss. You should equip a Faceted Ruby in at least Aurora's
weapon slot. Beware of the boss' Autumn Chill attack as it can knock a party
member back on the timeline.
