# Coo template

This is a template for using the Jekyll theme
[Coo](https://github.com/quacksouls/jekyll-theme-coo) to create online
documentation.  Coo is a fork of the Jekyll theme
[Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/) with some
modifications to make it easy for creating online documentation.  This template
is based on the [Chirpy starter](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter)
template.  You might find the [Chirpy documentation](https://chirpy.cotes.page/)
useful to help you get started on Chirpy.

## Prerequisites

The Jekyll project has
[detailed instruction](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) on how to setup
Jekyll and Ruby.  [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is required as part of your
development environment.  You might find
[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (or its
[Linux version](https://github.com/shiftkey/desktop)) to be a friendly graphical
interface to Git and GitHub.

## Installation

Sign into GitHub and navigate to the template
[home page](https://github.com/quacksouls/tekyll).  Click on
`Use this template`, then click on `Create a new repository` to create a
repository based on the template.  Use Git or GitHub Desktop to clone your newly
created repository to your local machine.  At the top-level directory of the
repository, run the command:

```console
$ bundle
```

This would setup the Ruby and Jekyll environment for your repository.

## Usage

Refer to the documentation of the
[Chirpy template](https://chirpy.cotes.page/).
